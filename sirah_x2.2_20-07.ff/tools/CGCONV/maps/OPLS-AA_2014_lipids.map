# Notice: This topology uses a diferent naming convention, hence a different MAP file is needed.

# Notice: The original topologies have a bug in the AA-atom name of the Oleoyl tail
#         the atom C28 is named C27 causing C27 to be repeated twice in the structure.
#         If C27 is used for mapping, then two atoms are mapped to BCT2 causing an
#         error in AMBER/GROMACS.

# Notice: The original topologies have a bug, acyl tails 1-Palmitoyl and 2-Oleoyl are swaped.
#         The Oleoyl tail has the same atom name issue as POPC.
