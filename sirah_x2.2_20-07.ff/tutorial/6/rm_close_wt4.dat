# Example of selection file for Protein-Membrane systems
# This file was made for the system of Tutorial 6, it may not work out-of-the box
# in other systems.

# This is the regular selection for Proteins to asure their proper sovation

  WT4_prot  = (resname WT4 and within 0.3 of group Protein);

# This selection accounts for imprefections in the embedding procedure, leading
# to large empty volumes around the transmembrane region of the protein, which
# may be fill by WT4 molecules during the generation of the solvation box.
# The exclusion cut-off need to be set according to each system.

  WT4_lipid = (resname WT4 and within 0.5 of (name "BE*" "BC1*" "BC2*" "BCT*"));

# Output
  system    = not (same residue as (WT4_prot or WT4_lipid));
  system;
